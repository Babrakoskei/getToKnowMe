      <p>  Babra Chelangat Koskei is a beneficiary of AkiraChix  program. She is an aspiring 
       web developer and has  a  tremendous appreciation of art. She likes reading novels and sometimes
        writes for fun.  she is also a freelance writer and an  audio transcriber. 
        She recently found her love for coding through the AkiraChix program. 
        Her biggest achievement so far is participating in the Great Debators Contest in 2018, Nakuru and earlier this year,
        getting an offer of admissions for a scholarship from Toronto school of management in Toronto, Canada. She unfortunately
        could not fly to her dream destination due to covid regulations and visa restrictions. Being a strong 
        believer, Babra believes that there is a reason for everything and God has a plan for her and true to that, she found herself 
        in one of the most prestigious institutions offering a lucrative course in IT.
